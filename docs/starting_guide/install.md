# Installation dh5

You can install the DH5 library using either pip or by pulling the repository directly from GitHub.

## Option 1: Install via Pip

Open your terminal and run the following command

```sh
pip install dh5
```

## Option 2: Install from GitHub

You can also install DH5 directly from its GitHub repository. This option is useful if you want to work with the latest development version or if you need to customize the library. Here's how to do it:

1. Clone the DH5 repository from GitHub using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kyrylo-gr/dh5.git
```

2. Enter the directory and install the package.

```sh
cd dh5
pip install .
```

Instead `pip install .` you can run `python setup.py develop` if you prefer.

## That's it!

You've successfully installed the DH5 library. You can now start incorporating DH5 into your Python projects.
